# Just Cause 3 Mod Manager

JC3MM, or Just Cause 3 Mod Manager, is a mod manager for Just Cause 3.

JC3MM is designed to work out of the box with most of the mods at <justcause3mods.com>.

## Install

1. Go to steam, right click Just Cause 3 in your library and click `Properties`.
2. Click `Set Launch Options` and paste in this: `--vfs-fs dropzone --vfs-archive patch_win64 --vfs-archive archives_win64 --vfs-fs . patch_win64 --vfs-archive archives_win64 --vfs-fs`
3. Download and run <http://s.mort.coffee/jc3mm/setup.exe>.

## Why?

I find installing and uninstalling Just Cause 3 to be needlessly complex. This tool makes it easier.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute. I would especially like some help fleshing out this readme file.

If you want to contribute code, make sure that you:

1. Use tabs, not spaces, to indent.
2. Generally follow my code style:
	* Spaces between operators
	* Newline before {
	* Space before ( after statements
	* No space before ( after functions
